# Nixpkgs Overlay

This is my personal nixpkgs overlay with some packages I use. It's not intended
to be used by anyone else, but I don't see any reason to not make it public in
the unlikely chance that someone finds it useful.

The packages here are regularly built against nixos-unstable and pushed to [my
binary cache][1].
